My friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.][The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.][Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.

For entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.][Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.][Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.][Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.][This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.][For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.][Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.][We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.][YUM.

The entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.][My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.][Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.

If the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.][If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.][Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.",review,sqYN3lNgvPbPCTRsMFu27g,4,3,1

The plan last night was for drinks.]No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation.]But it turned into more.

*Spicy Buffalo ""Wings"": first things first...]do not let looks dismay you...]true it looks gross but they taste legit!

*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty.]The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor.]This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat.]Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.

*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling.]Another must try!

Lastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito...]delicious and huge.]A bit too much rice but besides that a great option.]It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.

Mr.]Mustachio had decided after doing a couple yoga classes with me at the ASU gym that he loved the stretch, so pursued a class for a semester at ASU this Spring and had the pleasure of practicing with Tish Hegel.]After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous.]He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.

That is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.

As for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself.]She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!).]

So far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes.]When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.

I ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.][Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.

Ambience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.][The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.][I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.][As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.][He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.][Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.

About 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.][Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.][I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.][When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.][She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.][I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.][For the price, adequate.][

Jasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.][The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!

On completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.][I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.][He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.][I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.][He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.][I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.

For the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.][For the wait on the bill, a little too long.",review,8qe2c5uRlAkvNFvDriBm1Q,0,2,0

Only complaint, wish members who didn't pay for the monthy tennis membership could still rent a court on a need by need basis.][ Regardless courts are top notch, great facilities and friendly staff.",review,_OLBq0aZR7K-UdPCrByatg,0,2,0
